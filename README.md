# Object_Detection_for_Visually_Impaired

1. Codes for Image Conversion: As the name suggests, these are the codes used for pre processing all the images to canny filtered, high pass filtered, high boost filtered and normalized high pass filters for better detection of the edges of the object.

2. Combined Code: You can pass through any image to detect whether an object is present in the image or not.

3. Neural_Network_Entropy_Variance: This code helps converting an image into it's individual entropy and variance and train a model based on the data available from them. THe data gained through these help in faster detection of the object.

4. Test_Images: It contains the code for testing the images and giving out an accuracy score for detecting the objects.

5. Train_Images: This code helps train all the images using neural networks and as whole images for object detection.
